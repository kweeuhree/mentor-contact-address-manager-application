Contact Management Application

Features:
- User registration and login functionality
- Contact listing page that displays all contacts for a logged-in user
- Basic validation for user input
- Mongoose Schemas

Future Development/Improvements:

This is an incomplete full-stack application. However in the future, I plan to expand on the backend/frontend functionality of this application to include:

- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations: Users will be able to add, edit, and delete contacts.
- Add Contact Page: A new page will be added to allow users to add new contacts.
- Contact Details Page: A page will be added to display detailed information about each contact.
- Search and Filter Functionality: Users will be able to search for contacts by name, email, or phone number, and filter contacts by category.
- Error Handling and Security: Additional error handling and security measures will be implemented to ensure the application is robust and secure.
- Google Maps Integration: Integrate with Google Maps to display contact addresses on a map.
- Social Media Integration: Integrate with social media platforms to display contact social media profiles.
- Birthday Reminders: Send users reminders of upcoming birthdays.
- Anniversary Reminders: Send users reminders of upcoming anniversaries.
- Meeting Reminders: Send users reminders of upcoming meetings.
- Customizable Themes: Allow users to customize the application theme.

  Technologies Used:
  - Frontend: Built with React using jsx and css for styling.
  - Backend: Built with Node.js, using Express.js as the server framework.
  - Database: MongoDB
